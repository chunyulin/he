Collections of small projects for the study of HE during 2021. 
- `compare_reorder`: a vector reduction benchmark for three popular HE libraries. In my implementation, Palisade is slightly faster than the rest of two.
- `heinfer`: secure inference by "vertical packing" via CNN with Palisade. See the [docker image submitted to iDASH2021](https://hub.docker.com/r/lincy/heinfer)
- `heinfer_peritem`: secure inference by "horizontal packing".
- `plot`: some script generating comparing plots on Twnia-2 and ARM cluster.
